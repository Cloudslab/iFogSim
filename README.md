# iFogSim2 (The New Version)
A Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Resource Management Techniques in Internet of Things, Edge and Fog Computing Environments with the following new features:
 * Mobility-support and Migration Management
   * Supporting real mobility datasets
   * Implementing different random mobility models 
 * Microservice Orchestration
 * Dynamic Distributed Clustering
 * Any Combinations of Above-mentioned Features
 * Full Compatibility with the Latest Version of the CloudSim (i.e., [CloudSim 5](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim/releases)) and [Previous iFogSim Version](https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim1) and Tutorials

iFogSim2 currently encompasses several new usecases such as:
 * Audio Translation Scenario
 * Healthcare Scenario
 * Crowd-sensing Scenario

# How to run iFogSim2 ?
* Eclipse IDE:
  * Create a Java project
  * Inside the project directory, initialize an empty Git repository with the following command:
  ```
  git init
  ```
  * Add the Git repository of iFogSim2 as the `origin` remote:
  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim
  ```
  * Pull the contents of the repository to your machine:
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```
  * Include the JARs to your project  
  * Run the example files (e.g. TranslationServiceFog_Clustering.java, CrowdSensing_Microservices_RandomMobility_Clustering.java) to get started

* IntelliJ IDEA:
  * Clone the iFogSim2 Git repository to desired folder:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim
  ```
  * Select "project from existing resources" from the "File" drop-down menu
  * Verify the Java version
  * Verify the external libraries in the "JARs" Folder are added to the project
  * Run the example files (e.g. TranslationServiceFog_Clustering.java, CrowdSensing_Microservices_RandomMobility_Clustering.java) to get started
